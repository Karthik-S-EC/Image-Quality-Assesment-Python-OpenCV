# Image-Quality-Assesment-Python-OpenCV
### Many Models were proposed. Check out the work by @clunietp (https://github.com/clunietp) and Image Quality Assesment (Score) Prediction based on BRISQUE IQA by @krshrimali (https://github.com/krshrimali/No-Reference-Image-Quality-Assessment-using-BRISQUE-Model)

Given an Image as Input, the code will generate different versions of image with different kinds of Blur and Noises and finds the best image out of those images which is close to Original Image

## Process

**Steps involved to Calculate the Image Quality Score using BRISQUE Model (No Reference Image Quality Assesment)**

## Installation Instructions

**Python 3.x**
1.  OpenCV: 
    `pip install opencv-python`
2.  Scikit Image:
    `pip install scikit-image`
    
## Usage

**Python 3.x:**

1.  `cd Python/libsvm/python/`
2.  `python3 brisquequality.py <image_path>`
